# Short

Holding a short position is opposite of the conventional [[Long]] position. In this case, you bet on the decrease of the price of the security.

You sell a security which you don't own yet by borrowing it, then if the price falls, you buy the said security and keep the difference. If the price increases, then you incur a loss and have to buy the security at higher price than what you sold it for. This is called short selling.
