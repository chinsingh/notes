# Mix Engineering

Focuses on **the audio after it's been recorded**, and **concentrates on the aspects of blending or mixing the project tracks together, to create a finished track**. A mix engineer might work with anything from a single song to a full film soundtrack, including music, sound effects, and dialogue.

Mixing involves things like setting the levels of each track, panning the tracks using EQ, compression, reverb, delay, and other effects processors and plug-ins to create a balanced overall sound.
