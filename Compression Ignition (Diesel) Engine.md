# Compression Ignition (Diesel) Engine

Standard [[Four Stroke]] with the following additions:

- **Compression Stroke**: The air is compressed to such an extent that even contact with fuel will light it up, hence the name.
- **Combustion Stroke**: Fuel is injected through the [[Fuel Injector]] to trigger combustion in the [[Cylinder]].
