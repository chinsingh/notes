# Its the job of Management to make you understand their business

Stay away from annual reports where management doesn’t put a clear picture of what the company does, what are its future plans, what mistakes it has committed. If you’re not able to understand the business after reading the first 2-3 pages of management details and analysis, then it is somewhat clear that the management doesn’t want you to. If you’re unable to, it doesn’t mean that you’re less knowledgeable. It is the job of management, to make you understand its business.
