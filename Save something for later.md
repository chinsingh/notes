# Save something for later

- To check this
  - Look at/sing through first verse and first chorus
  - If everthing you have to say is already said by then, listener will have know reason to stick around
  - You might make that first verse, the third verse of the song.
- You want to have a little something going on thats going to advance the story.
- Maybe bring in a new character or maybe a different example of what the main theme is.
