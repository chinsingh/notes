# [[Index fund]]s have low [[expense ratio]]

One benefit of index fund is that its expense ratio is low (around 0.1%) whereas, in active funds even for a direct plan, the expense ratio is 1%. Thus, you're paying at least 0.9%-1% more fee in case of active fund. So if you save on this fee, you're basically getting yourself 1% return.
