# You can't trust your agents blindly

1. High Commisions: Agents get up to 25% commission if they sell you a plan.
2. Mistreatment on not achieving the targets: Relationship managers and agents don't get incentives if they don't meet their targets.

This drives them to sell the plans but this doesn't mean the plan is right for you.
