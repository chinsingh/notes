# Matter bends time
Since [[Light bends when passing near the sun]] it travels a longer distance crossing the sun within its gravitational field than a light beam travelling outside it. 

But for the sake of [[Constancy of light speed]], time itself has to slow down near the sun when it!

Thus, time must slow down proportionate to the curvature of space in order to keep the speed of light constant.

This is why [[Clocks on Earth are slower than clocks on ISS]]
