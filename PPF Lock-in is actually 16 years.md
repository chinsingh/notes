# PPF Lock-in is actually 16 years

PPF lockin is said to be 15 years but its actually 16.

Thats because the year you start investing is counted as the 0th year. The 1st year starts from the financial year after that.

Example: If you open a PPF account on 1st May 2021. 2021-22 will not be counted. The first year will begin from April 2022 and you will get your money 15 years after that on 1st April 2037.

You will definitely get interest for the extra months. Just that your maturity date will be later than expected. So plan accordingly.
