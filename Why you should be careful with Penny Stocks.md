# Why you should be careful with Penny Stocks

Many people are deceived into investing in penny stocks and loose lacs of their money.

1. A stock is a penny stock for a reason. The prices of stocks are decided by how much the market likes the stock or the company.
2. Some people say that the prices are low because the company is small now, and it might grow in the future. Although this is not always the case. The prices are not decided on the basis of how big/old the company is. The company might be small, but if the fundamentals are strong, for example, there is no debt, management is good etc.; then the prices could be high.
3. Some investors buy penny stocks due to the quantity they get. But the number of shares don’t matter as the returns you get is on the amount you invest. There’s another myth that cheaper shares grow quickly. Although the growth depends on the growth of the company.
4. Again, the price doesn’t decide if the share is expensive or cheap.
