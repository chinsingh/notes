# Multibagger

Stocks that give returns that are several times their costs are called multibaggers. These are essentially stocks that are undervalued and have strong fundamentals, thus presenting themselves as great investment options. Multibagger stock companies are strong on corporate governance and have businesses that are scalable within a short span of time.

A stock that doubles its price is called two-bagger while if the price grows 10-times, would be called a 10-bagger.

Companies with [[Brand Power]] have higher changes of being a multibagger.
