# ROE is more important indicator than Profit Margin

Example: Ram bought 10 pencils for ₹10 each and sold them at ₹20 each.

Here,
Profit Margin = 50%
ROE = 100%

Another guy, Shyaam sold the same pencils but for ₹15 each.

In this case,
Profit Margin = 33.33%

But since he was selling at a lower price and thus was able to sell more number of pencils, eventually earning more profit pushing ROE to 150%.

ROE is evidently, the more important parameter. There are many companies that keep margins low but earn more hence, giving more ROE.
