# Virtual Machines

- Software construct dressed up to look and feel exactly like a physical server
  - Each VM has its own virtual CPU, virtual RAM, virtual disks, virtual network cards etc.
  - OS is installed on top of it and to the OS, the VMs look exactly like a physical server — it doesn't know the difference.
  - Each VM steals the physical CPU, RAM and memory

## Story of VMs

- VMware brought the Virtual Machine technology when companies were struggling with [[Physical Server]]s. Now, instead of dedicating one server to one app — organisations could now host tones of applications on a single physical server and save [[resource wastage in physical server]].
