# About these notes

Hi! I’m [Chinmay Singh](https://chinsingh.github.io). You have bumped into my notes. These are just notes that I write for myself and I’m sharing them here. Since I write it for myself, you might not understand everything.

A little bit about structure - there’s not much. You can navigate using MOCs or Maps of Contents which you can treat sort of as an index for a particular topic.

Go [[+Home]] to get started.
