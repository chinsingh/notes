**Zero Interest rate bonds**: These bonds have 0% interest rate. This doesn't mean there are no returns.

## Zero Coupon

- You buy these bonds at a discounted rate which is lesser than the face value of the bond. The redemption occurs based on face value.
- For example: You buy a bond with face value ₹1000 at a discounted rate of ₹650. While redeeming, you get ₹1000 as lumpsum.

## Premium debentures/bonds

- You invest in these bonds at face value. But while redemption, these bonds offer you a premium value higher than the face value.

## Subordinated

- Subordinated bond holders are paid after senior debt holders according to the [[Priority Order of Payback when a Company Liquidates]]
