# Design an application with no constraints

[Link to stackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64003764/design-an-application-with-no-constraints?noredirect=1#comment113242537_64003764)

How will you design an app which -

- Performs a number of tasks
- the tasks can be anything (any operation or program or literally just anything)
- there can be any number of tasks
- those tasks can have any number of inputs
- the task to be done may be sent as a payload
- the inputs may be sent as payload
- there can be any number of clients.
- the client can send any kind of request (GET, PUT, POST etc.)

List the classes and interfaces you'll create and describe the entire flow of the application. Everything should be "loosely-coupled".
