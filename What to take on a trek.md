# What to take on a trek

## Essentials

- Bagpack
- Rain cover for bagpack
- Trekking trousers (waterproof)
- Jacket (waterproof -10 C)
- Trekking shoes
- Lots of socks
- Volini

## Good to have

- Headlamp
- Hiking raincoat
- Powerbank
- Glucon D, Granola bars etc.

_NOTE: You can complete many treks without carrying anything at all. I have seen people go to treks empty handed without even a proper jacket, without phone or money. These people simply go and sleep in tents along with the guides and porters in their tents._
