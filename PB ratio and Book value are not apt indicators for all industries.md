# [[PB ratio]] and [[Book value]] are not apt indicators for all industries

## Where do these work?

Industries where most capital is spent on assets or cash. For example, heavy industries or companies which sell commodities where the brand is not important like cement, power, steel, manufacturing etc. or banks and financial institutions.

## Where these don't work?

### When Industry is not asset-based

Industries where hard-assets are not sought after. For example, IT or software companies. These companies don't actually need a lot of assets for their business to run. They don't need factories, machinery, logistics etc. Most of their cash is spent on assets like employees, which are technically not considered assets in accounting terms, and hence, the low book value.

But they can’t be judged on this basis. Thus, you’ve to see where the company derives its profit from. If its not derived from assets, then P/B is not applicable in that case.

### Depreciating Assets

In case of assets, you’ll have to see whether those assets are appreciating assets or depreciating assets. For example, land, gold etc are appreciating assets. But if a company has steel plant or cement plant, these are depreciating assets. So the company might say that it has a factory worth ₹5 crores. But if the company shuts down and sells, the plant might not sell for even ₹2 crore. So, don’t trust the book value even in case of depreciating assets.

### Companies with a strong [[Brand Power]]

For example, you can't measure Apple's value with the book value.
