# Shepard Tone - Dunkirk effect

- Ticking is a common theme across Hans Zimmer's work.
  - Example - Interstellar, Sherlock Holmes(Movie)
- In Dunkirk, the ticking makes way for an orchestra which seems to be rising higher and higher.

## Shepard Tone

An auditory illusion

Several tones seperated by an ocatave layered on top of each other.

As the tone moves up -

- Higher pitch gets quiter
- Middle pitch remains loud
- Lowest bass pitch starts to become audible

Because you can always hear two tones rising in pitch at the same time, your brain is tricked into perceiving it as a constant assending tone. Sounds like a piano scale going on for infinity

When the transition between tones is continuous. Its called a **shepard-risset glissando. -**  Can sound really spooky.

This can happen in the opposite direction too.

Other examples -

Endless stairs in super mario 64.

echoes - pink floyd

In a soundtrack, it can create a sound of rising tension that takes the screenplay forward

Christopher nolan loves this illusion.

Used The dark knight films

colorado springs -the prestige

Nolan's movies revolve around time and how it warps in space, in our dreams etc. The tension which comes with that is demonstrated aptly using this sound design
