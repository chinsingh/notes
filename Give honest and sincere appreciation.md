# Give honest and sincere appreciation

- To feel important is the ultimate desire in a human being.
- If you notice something good about a person, let them know you like that.
- Where everyone goes wrong is they tell and yell at the person for doing something wrong. But they never thank the person for doing something right.
- This constant craving for importance is so unsettling, people achieve greatness or even go insane looking for that feeling of importance.
- We are not talking about flattery here. That's insincere.
