# Object Oriented Programming MOC

## Entities/Components

- [[Class]]
- [[Object]]
- [[Friend Class]]
- [[Members of a Class]]

## Four Pillars + one secret basement of OOP

- [[Polymorphism]]
- [[Inheritance]]
- [[Encapsulation]]
- [[Abstraction]]:
  - [[Interface and Abstract Class]]
  - [[How do interface and abstract class achieve abstraction]]
  - [[When to use interface and when to use abstract class]]
- [[Association]]
- [[Composition over Inheritance]]
  - [[Purpose of Inheritance]] vs [[Disadvantages of Inheritance]]
  - [[Benefits of Composition]] vs [[Disadvantage of Composition]]

## OOP Features

- [[Everything is an Object]]
- [[Method Overloading]]
- [[Method Overriding]]
- [[Static Binding]]
- [[Dynamic Binding]]
- [[Runtime Polymorphism or Dynamic Method Dispatch]]
- [[Shadowing or Hiding]]
- [[Subsitutability]]
- [[Variance]]

## Types of members/classes

- [[Static]]
- [[Final]]
- [[Abstract]]

## Accessing/referring objects

- [[Self-reference]]
- [[super keyword]]

## Playing with Objects

- [[Object Cloning]]
- [[Object Type Conversion]]: [[Upcasting]] | [[Downcasting]]
- [[Serialization]]
- [[Deserialization]]

## Object Oriented Design

- [[Design an application with no constraints]]
- [[When to use interface and when to use abstract class]]
