# Arousing an eager want

- What do you do when you want someone to do something?
- Whether it's getting someone to buy your product, or telling your child to eat his breakfast. You simply tell them.
- But why will they do it? What's in it for them?
- That's where you fail. You failed to see the point of view of the other person.
- Again, be empathetic and see, why they should do it?
- Tell the buyer what benefits he'll get from buying the product. Be genuine. Don't try to scam. It should actually be a win-win situation. You get what you want and the buyer get what he wants. Your child eats the breakfast and he gets to get strong and stand-up to the bully in his school.
