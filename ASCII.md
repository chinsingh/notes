# American Standard Code for Information Interchange

To encode entire english alphabet considering the cases and including the punctuations, special characters and numbers requires 7 bits of information - since all of them combined total up to 95 (falls between $2^6 = 64$ and $2^7 = 127$).

This was formulated in 1963.
