# [[Enterprise Value]] is a more accurate indicator of the price of a company than [[Market Capitalization]]

Tells the actual price of a company — more important than market cap.

Example: You by a shop from your friend for ₹100. It has ₹20 in its vault but you have to pay someone ₹30. So eventually, the shop cost you ₹90. That is its enterprise value.
