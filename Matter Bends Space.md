# Matter bends Space

According to classical mechanics, gravitation is a force. That means, there should be no difference between the acceleration due to gravity and acceleration due to any other force. 

An effect of acceleration is [[Light pointed perpendicular to the direction of motion of an accelerating body will bend wrt the body]]. But this bending of light is not seen on earth.

Or is it? üòè

[[Light always takes the quickest path]] but what if this path was curved. Consider earth for instance. To go from New Delhi to New York, you can take the quickest possible path by flight but your path would still be curved since the surface itself was curved.

This is what happens with light. The gravity bends the space according to the mass of the body and thus, although light appears to be travelling in straight line, it goes through a curved path. Since space itself is curved. With respect to space though, light is still travelling in straight line. 

Einstein's theory proposed that gravity was not a force, but a result of this interaction of bodies with space. 

This was proven by the experiment by Sir Arthur Eddington in 1919 to see if [[Light bends when passing near the sun]].
