# Blank Final Variable

Final variable not initialised during declaration

All final variables must be initialised, or else => Compile time error

## Ways to initialise
  
- Can be initialised within an [[Instance Initialiser Block]]
- Can be initialised within a constructor
- If there are multiple constructors
- Initialise in all of them, or else => Compile time error
