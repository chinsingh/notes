# Method Overriding

When a child class has same method as that of a parent class, that method is said to override the parent's method.

## How can it be achieved?

- Method must have same name as parent
- Same parameter as parent
- Return type must be same or have an IS-A relationship with parent method's return type [[Covariant Return Types]].
- Overridden method should not be more restrictive than parent method.
