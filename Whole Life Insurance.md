# Whole Life Insurance

Whole Life Insurance covers you for your entire lifetime unlike [[Term Insurance]].

Although, whats the need of having coverage when you're not earning or supporting any dependants. If you die after retirement, getting this money will only serve as a compensation for your grieving family members. The [[True Purpose of a Life Insurance is to serve as a replacement when a source of income dies]], not to compensate the loss of life.
