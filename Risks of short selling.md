- In case of [[Intraday Short Selling in Stock Market]], if a stock hits [[circuit]] at the time of [[Auto Square-off]], even the broker can't buy the stock. In that case, you become a defaulter and penalty will be levied on you.
- In case of [[Short-term short selling through SLBS]], the stock price can increase by any amount, even more than 100%. There is no limit on how much a stock price can increase => there's no limit of how much loss you can incur - if you haven't put stop loss.
