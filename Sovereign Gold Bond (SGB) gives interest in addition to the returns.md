# [[Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB)]] gives interest in addition to the returns

The worst thing about gold is that, once you buy and keep it, it is not going to pay you unless you sell it. Neither does it give regular income like property, nor does it pay you dividends.

Even though buying SGB is just like buying physical gold. In that, youâ€™ll get the price of gold while selling. But in addition to that, you get **2.75% annual interest on the amount of gold you buy**. Thus, **not only the gold pays while selling, it can now give you regular income.** This interest will be credited to your account in two halves, twice a year. The biggest problem of gold investment too, is hence solved by this scheme.
