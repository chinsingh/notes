# Rebate u/s 87A

- If net [[taxable income]] ≤ ₹5 lacs ⇒ NO TAX
  - Rebate is offered up to ₹12,500 if taxable income is up to ₹5 lacs.
  - Rebate is deducted directly from the tax liability, not from the gross total income or taxable income.
  - For example, Gross total income is ₹6,00,000 and deductions amount up to ₹1,50,000. This makes the taxable income ₹4,50,000.
  - On this amount, the tax amounts to ₹10,000. Now since, the taxable income is less than ₹5 lacs. You won't have to pay any tax as the rebate offered is up to ₹12,500.
  - ₹12,500 is in fact, the tax liability of a person with taxable income equal to ₹5 lacs. Thus, it can be said that if your taxable income is less than or equal to ₹5 lacs, you don't have to pay any taxes.
- Rebate is also applicable in case of LTCG tax.
  - Even though the tax on LTCG is calculated seperately, the rebate will be subtracted from the LTCG tax if the taxable income is below ₹5lacs.
