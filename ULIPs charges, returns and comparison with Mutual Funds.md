## Returns

- The structure might be similar to mutual funds, but it can't give the same returns since there are so many charges
- If you're investing some amount and 10-11 % is deducted as charges, even if a ULIP manages to give 11% annual return, you're back to the same amount ⇒ 0% profit.
- ULIPs' returns do not beat mutual funds' return.
