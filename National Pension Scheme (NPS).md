# National Pension Scheme (NPS)

## Reasons to invest in NPS

- It's a great scheme if your annual income is above 10 lacs i.e. youâ€™re in 30% tax bracket. You should invest at least â‚¹50k in NPS.
- If you think, you donâ€™t have the financial discipline to save money for your retirement, then NPS is a must.
- The government is continuously making NPS more and more attractive. So the tax slab on NPS may be reduced, or the tax-free percentage might be increased in future.
- When a nation progresses, the taxes are reduced generally. So hopefully, years from now, if India develops a lot, then the tax might be reduced. So today if you save 30% tax on some amount, in future you might have to give just 5 or 10% tax on it.

## Advantages

- Plan your own returns

    Most private or traditional schemes use debt instruments. That is, they invest their money in private/government bonds. Returns in bond market are fixed, but less.

    NPS gives you the power to decide the percentage of your money you want to invest in private bonds, government bonds or equity so that you can put money based on your risk profile.

    If you want higher returns, you can put more money in equity. On the other hand if you want lesser risk, then you can totally forget equity, and invest just in bonds.

- Auto-choice feature

    If you are unaware of what to do and how much to invest, you can select this feature instead of going to financial planners who generally charge hefty amount.

    What happens when you opt for this is that the percentage of your money invested in equity is high at first when youâ€™re young. It then gradually decreases, and more and more part of your money is invested in government securities/bonds as you age.

- Tax Benefit

    Money invested in NPS is NON-TAXABLE.

    That is, it gets deducted from your taxable income. (Section 80CCD*)

    *Different from 80C, which exempts up to â‚¹1.5lacs from taxation if youâ€™re investing it in mutual funds, life insurance etc.

    So, 80C + 80CCD can save you a lot of tax. Even while withdrawing, 40% of the money if tax-free.

- Better Returns

    Returns are higher than PF and other traditional plans, especially, if youâ€™ve chosen equity option.

- Convenience

    Online process to open an account.

- Flexibility

    There are many pension schemes and you can easily change your pension schemes for up to two times a year. You can also invest either lump sum or through SIP.

## Shortcomings

- Lock-in period

    Whatever your age be, **you can only withdraw once you turn 60**, which is a **very long lock-in period**. This can both be an advantage and a disadvantage. As you **cannot take it out in time of need**. Although, **this ensures that you have money for your retirement**.

        ðŸ’¡ If there is a serious emergency within the lock-in period and you can justify it, youâ€™ll be able to withdraw 25% of what you have in NPS.

- Mandatory Annuity Plan for 40%

    When you withdraw, youâ€™ll get 40% at once which wonâ€™t be taxed. But **youâ€™ll have to take an annuity plan for other 40%** so that youâ€™ll get your monthly income from that**.** The remaining 20% can either be withdrawn at once or you can take an annuity plan for that too.

- Annuity is Taxable
