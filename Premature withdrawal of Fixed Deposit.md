# Premature withdrawal of Fixed Deposit

Fixed Deposits,Â with premature withdrawal facility, allow the depositor to close the FD before the date of maturity arrives.

Some banks levy penalty of 0.5% and 1% on the interest for premature withdrawal. Some banks also offer premature withdrawal facility with zero penalty charges.

If the FD is prematurely closed, before completing 7 days from the date of the booking, the bank or the company is not liable to pay any interest.
