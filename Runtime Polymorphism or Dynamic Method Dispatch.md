# Runtime Polymorphism or Dynamic Method Dispatch

## [[Method Overriding]] + [[Dynamic Binding]] = Runtime Polymorphism

- Method Overriding - Which Method to call depends on object type
- ++
- Dynamic Binding - Object type determined at runtime
- => Which method to call - decided at runtime
- -> Runtime Polymorphism
- [[Object being referred to determines the version of method to be called]]
