# Oats smoothie Recipe

## Ingedients

- 3/4 cup oats
- 2-3 Bananas (Prferably, small ones since they bind better - possibly more gluten)
- 1 glass milk
- 1 scoop Protein powder
- 1 tbsp Honey

## Directions

1. Soak the oats in water for a few minutes. The oats shouldn't be submerged in water completely, it should just dampen the oats so as to avoid lumps.

    Don't drain out the water. It has good stuff.

2. Puree it in blender once and then pour milk. Shortly mix it in blender.
3. Now put bananas and spin. This time for a little longer
4. Finally put the protein powder and honey and blend it like Beckham. Don't put the protein powder or honey along with the bananas at first as it stops the bananas from properly blending and leaves lumps and pieces of banana in the smoothie.
