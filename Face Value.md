# Face Value

Shares were earlier traded in form of certificates and face value was written on them similar to how its printed on currency notes or agreement papers.

Face Value has nothing to do with the price of the share and you can't judge a stock as expensive or cheap on basis of face value.

ðŸ’¡ You can think of face value as similar to weight in case of metals. You won't prefer buying 10g of iron over 10g of silver or gold because its cheaper.

Face Value simply tells how many shares has the company's total shares been divided into. For example, a company wants to put up shares worth â‚¹1 lac in stock market. It can either give 1000 shares of â‚¹100 or 10,000 shares of â‚¹10. Thus, face value is nothing significant.
