# Zydus - Business Analysis

The greatest thing about Zydus is its net profit margin is a huge 50% which is very rare in FMCG companies. This sort of margin is expected in monopoly companies like Coal India or NMDC which have around 40% of margin, because they have no competition. The fact that Zydus has such a large margin proves that it has no competition. This can also be seen in real life. There are very few substitutes of sugar free, and they’re not so popular. Same with Nutrilite. Everyouth might have competition, but its facemask is the market leader in the category. Thus, two products being a monopoly and the third product being the market leader, makes 3 out of 4 products, a market leader.

Monopoly despite growing industry — [[brand power]]. For instance, Sugarfree. The name itself represents the product. Once this kind of brand image is created, it becomes very difficult for any other player to enter the market as in a consumer market, brand carries a lot of importance.
