# Calculating Income Tax

- Tax is calculated on the [[Taxable Income]].

- [[Income Tax Slabs]]

- The Wrong Way

    My taxable income is ₹6,50,000.

    Lets see which tax slab it falls in.

    It falls under the 5-10 lacs bracket. So my income will be 20% of 6.5 lacs i.e. ₹1,30,000. ❌

- The Right Way

    Consider the case, where your gross taxable income is ₹8 lacs. The tax is calculated as follows:

    You don't have to pay any tax up to 2.5 lacs. So remove that component from your taxable income.

    Now you're left with 5.5 lacs. Of this remaining amount, the 5 lac component will be taxed according to the ₹2.5 - 5 lacs bracket i.e. 5%. Again, you're left with 1.5 lacs which will be taxed at 20% (₹5-10 lacs bracket).
