# Creating Objects in C++

## Static Memory Allocation

```cpp
Box b1; 
//Object created with name b1 
```

## Dynamic Memory Allocation

```cpp
Box *p=new Box(); 
//Pointer p points to the created object 
```

(_Parentheses in the second statement is optional. Using parentheses will call a constructor without arguments._)
