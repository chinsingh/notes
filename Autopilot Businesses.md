# Autopilot Businesses

> A good CEO is one who does nothing

You can look for businesses that run on autopilot. That is, where the CEO is just for the sake of it, and he/she has to do nothing for the company to keep running. This lessens the chance of human error. And if tomorrow the CEO changes, it won’t affect the business of the company. For example, Hindustan Unilever. Its products are such that they’ll keep selling, no matter who the CEO is. On the other hand, Interglobe aviation or Indigo is in profit only because of its management. It is in the airline industry, where most of the airlines are incurring losses. Spicejet fluctuates between profit and loss, Air India is always in loss, Kingfisher airlines went bankrupt. So the problem and irony with Indigo is, it can’t run on autopilot. It manages to stay in profit only because of the efficient management. Indigo even after being run at its greatest efficiency is able to generate only moderate profits and gives moderate returns. And it can’t work any better. Also, in case of a sudden accident, it’ll go into loss. There’s no saving it. You want a business that can give you great returns even while running on moderate efficiency.
