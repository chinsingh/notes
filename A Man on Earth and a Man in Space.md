# A Man on Earth and a Man in Space

This was Einstein's thought experiment which led him from the [[Principle of Relativity]] to the [[Equivalence Principle]].

According to Einstein: 
(Body = Man in elavator)
- [[Body free falling is same as body in space in uniform velocity]]
	If we suddenly teleport a man in an elavator falling on earth to space and leave him floating there, he'll have no way of knowing. He'd just think he's falling forever.
* [[Body placed in gravity is same as a body in space accelerating]]
