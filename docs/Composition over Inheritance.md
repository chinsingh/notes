# [[Composition]] over [[Inheritance]]

aka **Composite reuse Principle**.

It is a OOP principle which encourages the usage of composition for code reuse instead of inheritance.

However, it is still a principle and [[a principle is just in principle]]. Hence, this can be reframed better as -

> If you are going to use inheritance - think again, chances are you need composition.

## Trade-offs

- [[Purpose of Inheritance]] vs [[Disadvantages of Inheritance]]
- [[Benefits of Composition]] vs [[Disadvantage of Composition]]
