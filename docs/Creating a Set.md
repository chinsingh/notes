# Creating a Set

- Know how much time you have
  - Know how much time you're going to be on stage - length of set impacts flow and number of songs
  - 20-25 minute set >> 60 minute set (if you're new artist)
- First song - most important
  - most artists keep there best songs for last - doesn't work well if you're new and people don't know your songs. If you're new, what you're going for is first impression.
- Switch up tempos and energy: It can be helpful to draw your desired [[Energy Curve for Performance]]
- End with a bang: leave your audience wanting more
- Plan your key messages: What do you want to promote and get across to the audience
  - Your band name
  - Your new single
  - Your social media push
  - Merchandise on sale
  - Your next gig
    Here's why its important to master the art of speaking during performance though. If you do it long and in between sets, audience starts to loose attention. To keep their attention, pro musicians talk in between song and build it back up again so they can get their message across without the awkward silence in the middle of songs.
- Make a note of guitar changes
