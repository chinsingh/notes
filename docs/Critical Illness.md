# Critical Illness

In this rider, you get the whole insured amount at once if you are diagnosed with the listed illnesses like cancer, kidney failure etc., not matter what your expenses are. For example, if the insured amount is ₹25 lacs, you’ll get those ₹25 lacs whether your expenses are ₹10 lacs or ₹50 lacs. You don’t have to show the bills, just the diagnosis is enough.
