# [[Concurrent]] vs [[Parallel]]

[**The Art of Concurrency**](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596521547.do) defines the difference as follows:

> _A system is said to be_ concurrent _if it can support two or more actions_ in progress _at the same time. A system is said to be_ parallel _if it can support two or more actions executing simultaneously._
