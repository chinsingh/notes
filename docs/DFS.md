# Depth-first Search (DFS)

- Start at root node.
- Explore each branch as far as possible (till its depth).
- No more vertex left in that branch?
- Come back to where you can find vertices and start again.

Start - explore - backtrack - repeat.

## Preorder and Postorder DFS

- **Preorder**: When the node is "visited" while traversing to the depth.
- **Postorder**: When the node is "visited" once we have encountered the leaf node.

## Applications of DFS

- Cycle Detection
- Finding connected components
- Topological Sort
- Maze generation
