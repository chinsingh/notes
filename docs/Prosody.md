# Prosody

> Every great work of art displays the same quality - unity
-Aristotle

Prosody is the patterns of rhythms and sounds in poetry and music.

- What to do if you have too many ideas?

    Decide based on what will fit together with other elements the elegantly in order to tell the story you want to tell, convey the emotions you're trying to convey. Leave out what doesn't.
