# Protection

Companies can enjoy protection in various ways -

- **Government Control**: For example, Credit Rating Agencies. The companies who can give credit ratings are regulated by the government. In India, only six companies are allowed to operate in this area. So in this case, the companies are protected by the government, and no one can simply enter the market. Thus, you can at least know, that these companies will continue to grow as they have done in the past.

    Jio bought the company that bought wireless broadband spectrum and later, government also allowed voice calls on it. No other company had this spectrum by the time.

- **Limited Resources**
- **[[Intellectual Property Protection]]**: Example of a IPP is patents. Pharmaceuticals and technology companies usually have this protection. No other companies can manufacture the product until the patent expires and in the duration of the patent the company has monopoly over the market.
- **Exclusive Rights**: For example, some companies give exclusive rights to retailers like Amazon and Flipkart.
