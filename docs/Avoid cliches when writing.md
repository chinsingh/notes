# Avoid cliches when writing

- Avoid clichés like I love you so much, she left me etc.
- There are many ways to say something
- Paul Simmons - Darling Lorraine

    When he wrote the first line - all his life he has been a wanderer - which is a cliche. He turned it down and said instead I've lived close to my parents. He dealt with the cliche.

- Impossible to completely avoid them. Just be intentional about it.
- Make sure you don't just write cliché after cliché.

> Sometimes the most beautiful poetry can be about simple things, like a cat, or a flower, or rain. You see, poetry can come from anything with the stuff of revelation in it. Just don’t let your poems be ordinary.
    - Dead Poets Society
