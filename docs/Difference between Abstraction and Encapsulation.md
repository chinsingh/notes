# Difference between [[Abstraction]] and [[Encapsulation]]

|  Abstraction                                                                                          | Encapsulation                                                                           |

| Process or method of gaining the information                                                         | Process or method of containing the information                                         |
| Problems solved at design or interface level                                                         | Problems solved at implementation level                                                 |
| Implemented using abstract class or interface. Implementation complexities hidden using these tools. | Implemented by class and access modifiers. Data hidden by using getters and and setters |
