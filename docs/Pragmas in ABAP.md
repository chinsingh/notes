# [[Pragma]]s in ABAP

Similar to [[Pseudo comments in ABAP]], these are program [[directive]]s used to hide/ignore warnings from check tools inlcuding ABAP compiler syntax check and extended program check.

```abap
MESSAGE e001(ad) INTO DATA(lv_message) ##NEEDED.
```

Tells the check tools that even though the variable lv_message isnâ€™t used for further processing, the variable is still needed. In this specific scenario, it is needed since we want to be able to perform a where-used search for the message AD 001 from transaction SE91.

## Syntax

- Pragmas are placed before the period
- Multiple pragmas, if required, can be placed one after other seperated by space.

To find mapping between Pseudo comments and pragmas - run  `ABAP_SLIN_PRAGMAS` or open the table `SLIN_DESC` in SE16.
