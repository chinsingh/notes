# Too many Related party transactions indicate something fishy

For example, there are two businesses of a person. Company A is flourishing, while company B is going in loss. Company B is unable to get loan from bank because of its condition. So company A takes loan from the bank which it can get easily, and lends it to B. Such transactions are called related party transactions. Its not a good sign if there are many of these, at a less interest rate.
