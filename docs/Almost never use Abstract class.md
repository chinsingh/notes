# Almost never use [[Abstract]] class

Abstract classes are mostly used in one-of-two ways:

- [[Abstract Classes for providing flexible behavior for related classes]]
- [[Abstract Classes as a helper class]]

Both these ways are better off substituted and hence an abstract class should almost never be used since you should try to prefer [[Composition over Inheritance]].

However, this is still a principle and [[a principle is just in principle]].

There are still scenarios, where using abstract class can be perfectly fine. You can still consider [[When to use interface and when to use abstract class]] and use [[Abstract Class as a stepping stone]].
