# Final

## Final method

Can't be overridden

## Final class

- Can't be inherited
- Are all methods final in a final class?

    Class can't be inherited — how will you override?

- If class is final and abstract — it should have static components only

    Doesn't make sense to have instance components if it can't be instantiated or inherited.
