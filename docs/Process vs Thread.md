# [[Process]] vs [[Thread]]

| Process                                               | Thread                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Each process is allocated a seperate memory area      | Threads share the same address space     |
| Process is heavyweight                                | Thread is lightweight                    |
| Cost of communication b/w processes is high           | Cost of communication b/w threads is low |
| Switching from one process to another takes some time |                                          |
