# Sanskrit as an Interface

Rick Briggs, A scientist from RIACS, NASA, has written a paper in 1985 titled "Knowledge Representation in Sanskrit and Artificial Intelligence".

**Misconception**: NASA claimed Sanskrit is best language for coding. Sanskrit can replace C++ and other high-level languages.

For high-level language, any language can be used. Since eveything is gibberish for a computer. Any high-level language has a set of keywords which can be picked from any language. Eventually, it has to be converted to 0s and 1s.

## Why Sanskrit is the best language for encoding human thoughts in a way a computer can understand?

1. **Pure Language**: Languages across the world are no more pure. Each of them have taken some elements from the other. Going back in time, as far as when there were only 2-3 major languages (Sanskrit, Greek, Latin etc).

2. **Algorithm already in place**: Maharishi Panini's [[Ashtadhyayi]] already encodes Sanskrit. Due to the [[Algorithmic Structure of Sanskrit Grammar]], it can be derived out of the [[Meta Language]] and is very similar to the coding languages of today.

## Examples mentioned in the paper and more advantages

1. [[Order of Words don't matter in Sanskrit]]
2. [[Each word in Sanskrit can carry multiple pieces of information]]
3. Using [[Kaarak]]s, computer can extract extra information from a sentence while working within a fixed domain.

    For example, John gave the ball to Mary.

4. One word can take seven forms using [[Vibhakti]]s as compared to 3-4 forms in other languages.
