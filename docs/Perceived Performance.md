# Perceived Performance

Not a substitute to [[Good Performance]].

Users judge performance subjectively which at many times differs from objective performance.

## Perceived Time relates directly to enjoyment, age and experience
  
- If the user is enjoying and having fun, he is more tolerable and perceived time may appear to be faster. If the user is frustrated, the time perceived by him will appear to be slower than real.
- You can use [[Idleness Aversion]] to create a "tolerable" experience if your performance ain't good enough.

Perceived perfomance depends on:

- Prior experience which set the expectations.
- Time is relative to expectation - [[Maister's First Law of Service]]: Exceeding user expectation makes them content and happy.
- How soon users can continue their work
  - How soon they can start reading
  - How soon they can start interacting (clicking, typing etc.)
- How successful users are in completing their tasks
- How well the interaction conforms to events in the real world
  - Example: Shopping Cart, Checkout counter
