# Wait till the last day to ensure listing gains in IPOs

Wait till the last day even in these cases to see how much over-subscribed they are. If there is a good amount of over-subscription, it will ensure the listing gains if you get the IPO. Also, whether or not you get the IPO does not depend on how early you apply for it, so there is no harm in waiting till the last day to place your bid.
