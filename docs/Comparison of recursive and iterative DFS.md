# Comparison of recursive and iterative DFS

- Both [[Iterative Implementation of DFS]] and [[Recursive Implementation of DFS]] have the time complexity of $O(V+E)$, where $V$ are the number of vertices and $E$ are the number of edges.
- [[Recursive Implementation of DFS]] is cleaner and more readable.
- [[Iterative Implementation of DFS]] though is more extensible. As in, it can be tweaked to incorporate other algorithms.
- Using [[Iterative Implementation of DFS]], you can explicitly specify the stack size. While recursive approach uses the OS' default stack size, which is still typically small - and thus can cause stack overflow.
