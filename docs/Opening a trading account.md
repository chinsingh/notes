# Opening a trading account

- Power of Attorney

    While opening account Zerodha will ask for power of attorney. Without power of attorney, you won’t be able to withdraw your shares from the DMAT account. Since, the DMAT account is maintained by a government agency, if the broker will not have the power of attorney, it won’t be able to withdraw shares when you’ll want to sell your shares. You’ll receive the paper on mail and you’ll have print, sign and courier it.

- KYC

    For full KYC too Zerodha can be used, since eKYC puts restriction
    of ₹50k while investing mutual funds.

- If the money gets deducted and account is not opened due to some mismatch in Aadhaar or PAN card, the Zerodha team will contact you in a few days and solve the problem.
