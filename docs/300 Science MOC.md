# Science MOC

## Philosophy of Science

- [[Einstein Synchronization Convention]]
- [[Measuring Speed of Light]]
- [[One-way speed of light can't be measured]]

## Mathematics

All of mathematics is based on [[The Axiomatic Method]]

### Geometry

[[Geodesic]]s

### Algebra

- Arithmetic Progression: [[Sum of first N natural numbers]]

## Physics

- Wave Mechanics
- Fluid Mechanics
- Chaos Theory
- Thermodynamics

### Quantum Physics

- Atomic theory
- Condensed Matter Physics
- Nuclear Physics
- Particle physics

### Quantum Field Theory

### Relativity

- [[Inertia]]
- [[Inertial Frame of Reference]]
- [[Gravity and space-time in Newtonian mechanics]]
- [[Light pointed perpendicular to the direction of motion of an accelerating body will bend wrt the body]]
- [[Matter Bends Space-time]]
- [[Bent Sheet Analogy for curved space-time is misleading]]
- [[Principle of Relativity]]
- General Theory of Relativity:
  - [[Matter Bends Space]]
  - [[Matter Bends Time]]
  - [[A Man on Earth and a Man in Space]]
  - [[Body free falling is same as body in space in uniform velocity]]
  - [[Body placed in gravity is same as a body in space accelerating]]
  - Phenomenons [[Explained by General Relativity]]
    - [[Apsidal Precession in Mercury]]
    - [[Light bends when passing near the sun]]

  - [[Keeping GPS satellites and earth in sync]]
  - [[Black Hole]]
- Special Theory of Relativity:
  - [[Constancy of light speed]]
  - [[Time Dilation]]

### Future

- [[Quantum Gravity]]

### Astronomy

- [[Apsis]]
  - [[Farthest point on orbit is apo, nearest is peri + greek suffix for the primary body]]
