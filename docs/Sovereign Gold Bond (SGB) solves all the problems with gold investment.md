# [[Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB)]] solves all the problems with gold investment

In last 70-80 years, Gold has given a return of 11-12%, which is more than FD and other traditional instruments. But while calculating these returns, people don’t count other charges involved.  While buying, and even after buying, there are many charges which eat up the returns. For example:

|                                                                                                                          Problems with Gold Investment                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                               Solution - SGB                                                                                                                               |

| **Making Charges:** If you’re buying jewellery, there’s a large amount of making charge. Even if you buy coins, there are some making charges. These making charges eat up your returns as when you sell the gold, you get only the price of the gold, not the making charges. | Since it is just a certificate, there are **no making charges**.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Concern about Purity:** If you buy gold from some small jweller, you can’t be sure about the purity, whereas if you buy gold from some trusted brand, the making charges go up despite the guarantee of purity.                                                              | These bonds are issued by RBI, and there’s a time period after which you can re-sell your bond to RBI and you’ll get the price of gold at that time. Since, these gold is in form of a certificate issued by the government itself, there’s **no chance of adulteration**. |
| **Safety Issue:** Even if you buy gold, the next concern is safety. If you keep it in your home, there’s definitely a chance of it getting stolen. Even the bank lockers don’t guarantee 100% security. Storage is one of the reasons people don’t buy much gold.              | Since the gold is issued in form of a certificate and lies in your DMAT account, **you don’t have to worry about its storage and theft**.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Other Ancillary Charge:** If you’ve bought gold in form of jewellery, it goes out of fashion in few years. It costs to get it made again and again after every few years. Even if you don’t, it at least needs polishing every few years.                                    | It is just a certificate in electronic form, so you **don’t have to pay for its regular maintenance.**                                                                                                                                                                     |
