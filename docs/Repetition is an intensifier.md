# Repetition is an intensifier

Repetition usually has a bad rap.

- **Repetition is an intensifier**
  - Although, Repetition itself is not annoying, its an intensifier (catalyst).
  - If repetition is connected to something annoying - it will make  it even more annoying.
  - But often, it can be connected to something beautiful and make it even more beautiful.
- Front loaded Refrain
  - When the first thing you hear is the title of the song and you hear it at beginning of every single verse.
  - John Lennon and his partner Paul McCartney were good at doing it. Example - Imagine, Penny Lane, Hey Jude and O Darling.
- Repeating same syllable
  - Bands like Queen used to do it
  - When you take the same syllable and repeat it over and over again - like, "no, no, no, no, no, no, no"
  - A much different way but still used to draw the listener and keep 'em engaged.
- Instrumental hook
  - If  there is not any repetition in your song, you can try putting in an instrumental hook.
  - Example, Somebody that I used to know - Gotye. Has two very strong instrumental hooks which are repeated again and again to keep the listener engaged and draw them in.

Repetition is not itself the culprit. Use repetition and rather than letting it use you, or worse, completely avoiding repetition.
