# High and increasing promoter holding along with Low Promoter Pledging is a good sign

## High Promoter Holding

Promoter means owner. Promoter holding can show how much the owners of the company trust their own business. A higher promoter holding (above 35-40%) is a good sign.

## Low Promoter Pledging

But this alone is not enough. Take a look at the shareholding pattern and insure that the promoter pledging is low too. Promoter holding can sometimes be misleading when even though its high, the promoters have pledged those shares to banks.

## Increasing Promoter Holding

You also need to look at the trends. Are the promoters buying or selling their shares over time? If the holding is decreasing. It means either they don't trust the company or they don't have enough money and have to sell the shares. Both of these are not good signs.

Exceptions to this rule:

- Professionally managed companies: Such companies are managed by multiple organizations and thus, won't have a high promoter holding. Example - ITC. [[FII and DII holdings should be high for professionally managed companies]]
- Banks: RBI puts restrictions on the holding of each promoter so the control doesn't lie with a single or fewer person.
