# Unit-Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP)

Two components -

## Insurance Plan

[[Life insurance]] cover.

- Premium and cover
- `~₹1cr` cover for `~₹10 lac` annual premium
- For life insurance you might want to go for 1cr cover if your income is 10 lpa (10x)

    But in case of ULIPs, your premium for that amount is 10 lpa which is your annual income. Ridiculous!

- This is why agents won't even try to sell you a cover this high. Instead they tell you about 5 lac cover.
- `~₹5 lacs` cover for `~₹50k` annual premium
- This is still expensive. Compare it to [[Term Insurance]] where you get a ₹1cr cover for ₹10-12k annual premium (age 25)
- Why so expensive?

    [[IRDA]] only regulates the [[Minimum Insurance Cover]] a company needs to provide for the amount of premium they're receiving. The maximum is in company's hands.

    ULIPs barely cross the minimum requirement.

## Unit Linked

Investment option

- Your money will be market-linked
- Similar to [[Mutual Fund]], companies offer different kinds of ULIPs like small cap, large cap, equity, debt etc.
- According to your risk profile and goals - you can distribute your fund.
- And like mutual funds, ULIPs offer 'units' of investment and price of one unit is NAV.
- ULIPs keep getting expensive exponentially.

## Tax Free ULIPs

After so many charges, even if the ULIP is tax-free, it doesn't mean anything.
