# Money doesn't get you happiness after a threshold

Correlation between "life satisfaction" and income actually depends on whether you're from a poor nation or wealthy nation. In case of poor nations, if income goes up, life satisfaction goes up. But if you're in a wealthy nation.

After you have your basic needs met, money doesn't matter for your happiness.

Emotional well being rises with income but only till a threshold.
