# Force Majeure

It simply means that if due to an [[Act of God]], company goes under or exhausted of its resources â€” the company can refuse to settle claims.

- Very unlikely though

    During COVID-19 pandemic, many insurance agencies tried to get out of paying claims for death by COVID. But [[IRDA]]  directed them, that they'll have to pay the claims irrespective of whether the death is caused by COVID or not.

- Force majeure is a big deal. Its not something a company can impose itself and stop your claim. Companies are answerable to [[IRDA]].
