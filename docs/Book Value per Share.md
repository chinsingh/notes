# [[Book Value]] per Share

- Value of a company per share on books.

$$
B.V. per share = Book value/No. of shares
$$

- Example

    *50/10 = 5 (Assuming 10 shares values at â‚¹20Â each)*

  - The amount of assets + cash a company has for each share. Theoretically, this is the amount you'll get if you have one share and the company gets sold or shut down.

ðŸ’¡ This doesn't happen practically, because when a company is sold its not priced based on just the hard assets or cash it holds.
