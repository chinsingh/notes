# Zydus - Valuation

P/E ratio of Zydus: 30

Which is slightly high. But again, the company is in FMCG sector which tend have premium pricing. For example P/E of Nestle and Britannia are around 50 and 60 respectively. Although compared to these, the pricing seems cheaper, but both these companies have decent sales growth, whereas sales growth in case of Zydus hasnâ€™t been good in past few years. However, the margin is very high in its case and overall it seems a good company. Even though its P/E is half of that of Nestle and Britannia it needs to rectify its sales performance.
