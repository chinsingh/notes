# Tapering

Once the desired impact of [[Quantitative Easing (QE)]] is achieved, tapering is done as an incremental reversal of the QE.

Therefore, the central bank reduces the rate at which it acquires new assets. This is the first step in winding-down/completely withdrawing from a stimulus program.

- Reasons for Tapering
    1. Desired result of stimulating and stabilizing the economy is achieved.
    2. If the central bank continues to fill markets with easy money, it will result in high inflation.

- Taper tantrum

    Every time a taper is implemented, there is inevitably going to be some knee-jerk reaction and correction from the market which is called taper tantrum. This can result in reduction of the rate at which taper is implemented.
