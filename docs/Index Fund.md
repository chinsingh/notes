# Index/Passive Fund
-   Index funds simply invest in the companies which are in the index the country â€” NIFTY50 and SENSEX 30 companies, in case of India.
-   They are called passive because they don't require a fund manager who will decide the stocks to invest in. They don't require active monitoring.
-   These funds basically give returns according to the Index. For example, if SENSEX increases by 14%, the returns too are 14%.
	-   Index funds are further segregated according to [[market capitalization]]. So a particular Index fund will invest only in either large cap, mid cap or small cap index companies. Not multiple at a time.
- -   [Expense Ratio](https://www.notion.so/Expense-Ratio-a7b42954179e4c269af506b07a1a015a) : ~0.1% (Since no there is no fund manager in between)

ðŸ’¡ Investment advisor [Varun Malhotra](https://www.varunmalhotra.co.in/landing-page) strongly suggests that if you are new, just buy NIFTY50 and Sensex Index Funds.
