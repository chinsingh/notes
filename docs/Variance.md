# Variance

There are entities and components in programming languages like enumerables (enums), functions, arrays, lists etc.

We know how [[Subsitutability]] works in case of objects. This kind of replacement can also be done with the components of these types. This is called variance.

- When objects are replaced — substitutability
- When components are replaced — variance

The type of variance is decided by the direction in which the replacement is possible.

- [[Covariance]]
- [[Contravariance]]
- [[Bivariance]]
- [[Invariance]]
