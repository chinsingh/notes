# Only focus should be less brokerage while selecting a broker

- Features
    A new investor doesn’t need all the features provided by full service brokers. All you need is a website or a mobile application.

- Safety
    Almost all brokers are regulated by [[SEBI]], NSE and BSE. But regulation doesn’t ensure safety. They might give good offers on brokerage and registration charges, but if they go bankrupt, getting your money back is difficult. To ensure safety register with reputed brokers. So we’ll stick with top 5 brokers.

- Charges
    Usually on DMAT and trading accounts, three kinds of charges are imposed.

  - **Account opening charge** (one-time): ₹3-400 is reasonable price nowadays
  - **Yearly maintenance**: Mandatory
  - **Brokerage**
    - Many brokers charge in percentage. Too much money might be lost as brokerage in this case.
    - Additional Services
      - Stock Tips
            Many brokers offer services like stock tips which are not necessary. They offer stock tips to get you to trade more in turn increasing their brokerage.
        - Phone services
            Were needed when internet was not that fast. That is also not necessary nowadays.
    - The **only focus should be on less brokerage. Additional services are useless**
    - Full service brokers charge 0.5%. That is, 0.5% on buying and 0.5% on selling. This subtracts 1%.
    - Nowadays, discount brokers are available which don’t have a fancy office or phone service, but have a good app on which you can trade. And once you get the equity and keep it in your DMAT account, zero brokerage is charged.
    - Apart from this, some tax deductions might be there.

Select any [[Discount Broker]] from the top brokers in India.
