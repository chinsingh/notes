## Benefits

- Easy access to neighbours of a node -- useful in graph algorithms.
- Most real world graphs are sparse. That is, large number of nodes with fewer number of edges. For example, in a social network, there could be billions of people (nodes), but each person (node) will only have thousands of edges at most.
