# Static Methods

A static method

- belongs to the class rather than the object of a class.
- can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.
- can access static data member and can change the value of it.
- cannot be abstract because they can't be overridden.
- [[Static Methods can't access instance(non-static) variables]]
