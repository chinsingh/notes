# Choose [[Active Fund]]s for multi-cap diversity

When you invest in Index funds, you'll either invest in large cap index, NIFTY50, 100 or 200, or you'll invest in small cap index. Which means, by investing in one mutual fund, you won't get the exposure equivalent to multi-cap since your index fund will mimic one particular index only. Thus, if you invest in small cap index fund, your return will depend on how small cap companies are performing. 

If you invest in a multi-cap active fund, you get all kinds of allocation (large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap) and the fund manager can decide how much money to invest in a particular asset class at a given time. 

Thus, active multi-cap are a good option because you get exposure across markets whereas in Index funds, you get restricted to a particular class.
