# Good Job doesn't get you Happiness

You might think not getting a good job will make you unhappy, but it doesn't. There might be a drop, but its way less than what you'd expect.

Dan Gilbert and his colleagues did a survey on college students where they had them predict what there drop in happiness would be and when students were actually turned down, the drop in happiness wasn't as steep. There was in fact, no drop in happiness when the student thought the decision was >unfair.
