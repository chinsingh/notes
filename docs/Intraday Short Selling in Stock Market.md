# Intraday Short Selling in Stock Market

You have to sell the share on the same day.

Suppose you know that some company is going to post their quaterly results at noon. You feel that the results are not going to be good and share price are going to fall. You sell the stock before that. And once, the results are published and the price falls, you buy the same stock at the decreased price.

Stock exchange ledger gets updated on the next day. Since, you've bought and sold the same amount of stocks, your net position will be zero.

If you don't buy the stocks by the end of the day, your broker will automatically do it for you through [[Auto Square-off]].

If you don't have funds in your account to buy the share, the broker will give you a window of few days to add funds, if not, it will auction from your holdings.
