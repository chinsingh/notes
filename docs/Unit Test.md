# Unit Test

Unit testing is a process in which a developer ensures that the smallest testable units of their code - such as methods - are verifiable.

## Why write unit tests

This makes it easier to ensure quality, to refactor code, to perform [[regression testing]], and to implement according to the [[test-driven development]] model. Unit testing is an integral part of the development phase.
