# How topological sort is a natural outcome of reversing the postorder DFS

For a [[Topological Sort]], the nodes should be executed in order of their direction.

- The nodes with no prerequisites (no arrows pointing towards them) are the leaf nodes.
- The leaf nodes come first in a postorder search and we trace back our steps from their.
- For a [[Topological Sort]], the nodes with no prerequisites should be executed last.
- Since, the last node of topological sort is the first node of the postorder DFS traversal, and this order is maintained throughout the traversal => reversing postorder DFS automatically gives a topological sort for a Graph.
