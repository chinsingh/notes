# Cess

Basically, cess is a "tax on tax". This means, the tax is levied not on your income, but on the tax you pay. So, in the â‚¹5-10 lacs where the tax percentage is 20%, the health and education cess of 4% will be calculated on top of the 20%. That is, 4% of the 20%. If your tax in this bracket is 15,000, the additional amount which you will have to pay as health and education cess is 4% of 15,000.

ðŸ’¡ Health and education cess is collected with the aim of addressing the educational and healthcare needs of rural families in India.

Cess collected for a particular purpose cannot be used for or diverted to other purposes. A particular cess continues to be levied till the time the government collects enough funds for the purpose that it was introduced for.
