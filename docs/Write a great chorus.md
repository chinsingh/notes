# Write a great chorus

> A good chorus is something you can sing along with the second time it comes around. And a great chorus is a chorus that you'll actually be singing before it gets done the first time.

- Example:
  - Beatles Song - Hey Jude. Very different song form too. Doesn't get to the chorus till half the song after which it is the same chorus repeated over and over again.
  - All you need is love - beatles: Songs are mostly concise - has a central idea and very short chorus.
  - We will rock you & we are the champions
