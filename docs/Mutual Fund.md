# Mutual Fund

- Mutual fund collects money from people and creates a ‘money pool’. A fund manager then uses this pool to invest in stocks, bonds, assets. You don’t have to worry about where it is being invested because the fund manager takes care of it for a commission of 1% to 2%.
- Mutual funds are a great option for long term since instead of sitting idle, your money earns for you. Mutual funds are regulated by [[SEBI]], so they won’t run away with your money.

However, if you choose a incompetent fund manager, then he/she might lose your money by investing in bad stocks.
