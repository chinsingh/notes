# Music Producer

Another primary role in audio and music production. If you've already done some audio or music recording on your own, you've probably taken on some of the responsibilities of a music producer. The role of a music producer can vary,and the meaning of the title has changed a lot over the years. But these days, a music producer is the person who oversees the entire project in a variety of ways.

The producer often works with the performer by helping to select the songs that will go on an album, as well as refining or rewriting the songs themselves, and offering input or advice on the arrangement of the songs.Most producers are also deeply involved in the lyric and melody creation, beat making, and music writing processes. And in many cases, the producer also directs the recording engineer, or acts as the recording engineer him or herself, and will be hands on with the actual recording process through operating the gear and software.

The producer often sees any project through to its completion. Making sure it's mixed, mastered, and even released the right way.
