If a body is falling from a height under the influence of gravity it is weightless at that moment and at rest relative to other bodies falling along with it. Same as a body in space. 

In fact, there'd be no way of telling if they're moving without looking at the outside world since laws of physics don't work different for different velocities. 

This is the [[Principle of Relativity]].

- What if the body comes across a celestial body and falls on it, is it not accelerating? And is the free falling object also not undergoing [[acceleration due to gravity]]?
