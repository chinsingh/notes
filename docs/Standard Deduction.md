# Standard Deduction

In any case, even without submitting any claims, a standard deduction of ₹50,000 is made from the gross total income while determining the taxable income.

For example, your gross total income is ₹5.5 lacs (or less). After making the standard deduction, the taxable income comes out to be ₹5 lacs, which means you don't have to pay any tax.

If your income is ₹6 lacs. Deducting the ₹50k, you're left with ₹5.5 lacs. Now you only have to submit deductions worth ₹50k more to avoid paying any tax.
