# Template Method

[[Behavioural Design Pattern]]

## Goal

When you need to define certain steps in a particular order, but the internals of those steps can vary.

## Solution

Create a superclass (usually an abstract superclass), with a method containing the steps in the desired sequence. These steps will be in form of methods, which the subclasses can choose to skip or implement in the specific way.
