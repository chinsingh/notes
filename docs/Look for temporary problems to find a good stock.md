# Look for temporary problems to find a good stock

- Find an industry where there is panic: That is, an industry about which the market is negative. This increases your chances to get cheap valuation. Find a company in that market, which is otherwise a good company, but is unable to thrive because of being in that market.
- Find companies which are facing temporary problems but are otherwise good companies.
