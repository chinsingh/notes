# Ashtadhyayi

Ashtadhyayi by Maharishi Panini.

A book in which Maharishi Panini condensed all of Sanskrit within 4000 Sutras. You can use these 4000 Sutras to create any word or sentence in Sanskrit.

It is considered one of the earliest and greatest achievements in Algorithmic Process.

If someone coming from Greece, for example, wants to learn Sanskrit, and no one around knows Greek. Ashtadhyayi laid foundations for him to learn Sanskrit.

The book uses a [[Meta Language]] to create an [[Algorithmic Structure of Sanskrit Grammar]] so that the language can be formulated out of it.
