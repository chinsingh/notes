# Turbo Charged Engine

Since the exhaust gases are simply let out in a [[Naturally Aspirated Engine]], a large part of combustion energy is wasted. Turbo Charged Engine uses these exhaust gases to extract energy and thus being more efficient.

This is done by introducing a Turbo Charger between exhaust and intake.

## Turbo Charger

Turbo charger consists of two main parts -

- Turbine - gives it the name turbo. This is connected on the side of the exhaust.
- Compression blades: Its connected to the intake.

Both plates are connected through a shaft.

## Turbo Charging Mechanism

Turbine rotates due to the exhaust gas leaving.

Now, since the turbine is connected to the compression blades, it will start rotating too. Thus compressing the air while it enters and increasing efficiency.

### How it saves power?

- Since air is already entering in a compressed state. Its going to take lesser power to compress it in the cylinder.
- For doing this we are re-using the power from exhaust gases and thus saving energy which would otherwise be wasted.
