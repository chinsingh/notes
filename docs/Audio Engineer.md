# Audio Engineer

The term engineer is a very broad term that applies to many different audio related functions, but generally, engineering entails being directly involved with the gear used for recording and mixing, as well as with the actual practice of recording, mixing, and processing the audio that's being captured or performed. You'll likely have to do some or all of these things when creating music, so learning the fundamentals of engineering is in your best interest.
