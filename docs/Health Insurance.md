# Health Insurance

## Types of Health Insurance

---

### Accident Cover

In case of any accident, it gives you a big amount monthly or lump sum.

Good thing about accident cover is that its premium is very low.

In case of any disability, it gives you money to keep your home running.

### Critical Illness

It lists 20-25 critical illnesses like heart attack, cancer etc.

In case you get any of that, you just have to show the diagnosis proof and you‚Äôll get the amount at once without seeing the bills.

### Mediclaim

This is standard health insurance.

Its for any of your medical expenses like hospital, medicines, doctors etc.

If you get admitted for more than one day in the hospital, this will cover that expense and the cost of medicines for a few months after that.

## Things to look for because [[You can't trust your agents blindly]]

---

- Pre and Post hospitalization

    The number of days before and after hospitalisation the insurance will cover. A good policy will cover the expenses of about 30 days before hospitalization and 90 to 120 days post hospitalisation.

- Premium

    You can go to sites like policybazaar and compare the premium on whatever amount you want.

- Bed Charges

    See that the policy allows charges of single private room. Many policies pay only for twin sharing room, triple sharing room, general ward etc. This is not just about rooms. Many a times, the quality of treatment too depends on the room. So ensure that the single private room is covered upto at least ‚Çπ4-5k.

- [[Claim Settlement]]

    The percentage of chance that the company will actually settle your claim in case it is actually needed. Give priority to companies with higher percentages of claim settlements.

- Tie-ups with hospitals

    Check whether the your company has tie ups with good hospitals near you, so that you can get cashless facilities. If your company doesn‚Äôt have tie-up with the hospital you‚Äôre admitted in, then the claim process gets stretched unnecessarily. You‚Äôll have to pay yourself first, then you‚Äôll have to give the bills to the company, and the reimbursement can take up to 1-2 months. So see that the company has tie up with your hospital so you don‚Äôt have to pay and the company settles your bills directly.

- In-house claim settlement

    Some insurance companies hire a third party to verify that the person is really admitted, and to verify the hospital papers. These companies are called third party administrators and many times they put the customers through a lot of trouble while preparing correct report and settling the claim. So, select a company which sells insurance itself and settles claims itself. Such companies are called in-house claim settlement. Companies with in-house claim settlement are Star Health, Apollo Munich, Max Bupa, Bajaj Allianz, ICICI Lombard, HDFC ErgoÔªø.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Don't fill out the form in haste. Correctly fill out ALL the existing diseases.**

    This might increase your premium a bit, but will ensure that you get the claim.

    If you don‚Äôt fill a disease while filling the form, and later while some diagnosis, it comes up that the disease was in your medical history and you didn‚Äôt inform the company about it, then you won‚Äôt get the claim.

    So don‚Äôt forget to disclose all your diseases just to fill the form quickly or to save some premium

## Top-up and Super top-up Plans

---

Mediclaims are a bit expensive. Because, for a cover of ‚Çπ5 lacs, you might have to pay ‚Çπ10-15k, which is not affordable for everyone.

In such cases, top-up plans are helpful. In a top-up plan, you can take a mediclaim for a lesser amount like ‚Çπ2-3 lacs, so that your premium will be less.

But if you take a top-up, it will pay you ‚Çπ2-3 lacs (based on your plan) only when your hospitalisation cost is above some amount you decide, like ‚Çπ3 or 4 lacs.

Super top-up is similar to top-up.

But in top-up you have to exceed the limit at once to get the return from top-up.

In super top-up you have to exceed the limit within a year, so you can get hospitalised
many times and cross the limit. So super top-up is better.

## Specialised Cancer Care Plans

---

Cancer is generally covered in critical illness plans too. But they don‚Äôt cover early stage cancer such as 1 or 2 stage cancer. They don‚Äôt pay unless you cancer turns serious. But in specialised cancer care plan, you get paid as soon as the cancer is detected.

Take this plan if your family has a history of cancer.

üí° **Take accidental and critical illness cover along with your life insurance.**

    This is beneficial because, the premium of life insurance is fixed whereas the premium of health insurance keeps on increasing after a year or two. 

    So if you take these addons along with the life insurance, their premium becomes fixed too.
