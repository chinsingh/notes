# Verse and Chorus Form

Since 1960s, most music has been in verse and chorus form.

## Verse

Melody repeats, lyrics are different. (Typically)

## Chorus

Same melody and lyrics.

## Different ideas behind the two

Verse can be the place where you put all exposition of the song while Chorus is one core idea.

## Contrast between the two

- A good idea can be to keep contrast between the two. For example, if the verse is very wordy, you can let the chorus be a release - only 3-5 words; so that people have time to absorb what happened in the verse. This can be done in the opposite way too. But having contrast is the key
- Having the chorus pay off - To make the listener feel like chorus is the reward for sticking there through the verse

## Other Parts

### Bridge

- Introduces new material, often including lyrics, melody and harmony.
- Lyrically, this is king of where the big reveal happens.
- Often has something to do with the climax of the song. Either it is the climax of the song, or it can build up to the climax.

### Intro

- Usually an instrumental portion played at beginning of the song before the first verse.
- Why is it used?
  - Pull the listener in
  - Set the mood for the song
  - Invoke interest
- Wonderful if they earn their keep.
  - Shouldn't be four verse chords played over and over to make it 4 or 8 bar long. Which is not required
  - Intros need to pull people in and keep them interested.
  - One thing you can try is loosing the intro completely and make an entry with the verse or chorus directly. That way you pull the listener in directly.
  - Another strategy is to make it into an instrumental hook. It can be used in between the song or the outro but it needs to be very catchy. Pulling the listener, setting the mood and getting him/her interested is the key.
  - Wait and think about what the intro is going to be until you've worked on the song for a while. Don't just play the first four chords that you came up with when you first played the song and make that the intro.

### Solo

- One instrument playing a musical riff or variation of the melody
- To change the pace
- Doesn't need to be too long

### Pre-Chorus

- A pre-chorus is a short idea, often one or two lines, that sets up the chorus.
- It always occurs just before the chorus and helps the song build up to the chorus to make it more satisfying.

### Refrain

- A Refrain is often used in AABA song form, but is also common in Verse Chorus song form.
- A line that is repeated where the lyrics and melody are most always the same.
- Often come at the end of the verse, but may also come at the beginning, or multiple times within the verse.

## Putting parts together

After getting these different parts, think about how to put them together so that they make the most sense for your song, what you want to convey, to keep the listener involved in the journey you want to take them on.- Verse and Chorus
