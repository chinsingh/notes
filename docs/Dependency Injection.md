üëÜüèΩ This here is a [[Dependency]]

- Dependency injection is a design pattern in which, instead of creating the object ourselves in our code, we let some other entity create the object and "inject" into our class.
- ‚áí Dependency injection implements [[Inversion of Control (IoC)]]

[[Constructor Injection]]
[[Setter Injection]]
[[Parameter Injection]]
[[Backdoor Injection]]
