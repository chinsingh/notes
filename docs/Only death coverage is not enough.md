# Only death coverage is not enough

While buying life insurance, people think that if they die, there family will get the money to keep the home running. But death is not the only case where your family will need money and the [[True Purpose of a Life Insurance is to serve as a replacement when a source of income dies]]. If a situation comes when you arenâ€™t able to go to work or you lose your job, then too your family will need the money. So, only the death coverage is not enough, disablement coverage is necessary too.

Thus it is important to take [[Riders (Top-ups)]] in a policy.
