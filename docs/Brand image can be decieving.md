# Brand image can be decieving

Looking just at the [[Brand Power]] can be deceiving. For example, Kingfisher was a very successful brand before it went bankrupt. There might be companies, whose brand is well established and reputed, whose products are very successful but the company might be going in loss, or might be debt ridden. This might be because the company had spent so much on building its brand or a product, that it is not able to earn.
