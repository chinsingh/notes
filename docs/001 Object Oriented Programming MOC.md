# Object Oriented Programming MOC

## Entities/Components

- [[Class]]
- [[Object]]
- [[Friend Class]]
- [[Members of a Class]]

## Four Pillars + one secret basement of OOP

- [[Polymorphism]]
- [[Inheritance]]
- [[Encapsulation]]
- [[Abstraction]]:
  - [[Interface and Abstract Class]]
  - [[How do interface and abstract class achieve abstraction]]
  - [[When to use interface and when to use abstract class]]
- [[Association]]
- [[Composition over Inheritance]]
  - [[Purpose of Inheritance]] vs [[Disadvantages of Inheritance]]
  - [[Benefits of Composition]] vs [[Disadvantage of Composition]]

## OOP Features

- [[Everything is an Object]]
- [[Method Overloading]]
- [[Method Overriding]]
- [[Static Binding]]
- [[Dynamic Binding]]
- [[Runtime Polymorphism or Dynamic Method Dispatch]]
- [[Shadowing or Hiding]]
- [[Subsitutability]]
- [[Variance]]

## Types of members/classes

- [[Static]]
- [[Final]]
- [[Abstract]]

## Accessing/referring objects

- [[Self-reference]]
- [[super keyword]]

## Playing with Objects

- [[Object Cloning]]
- [[Object Type Conversion]]: [[Upcasting]] \ [[Downcasting]]
- [[Serialization]]
- [[Deserialization]]

## Object Oriented Design

- [[Design an application with no constraints]]
- [[When to use interface and when to use abstract class]]

### [[Design Pattern]]

  - [[Creational Design Pattern]]s
    - [[Singleton]]
    - [[Factory Pattern]]: [[Object Factory]] \ [[Factory Pattern using Friend class]]
    - [[Builder Method]]
    - [[Dependency Injection]] and [[Inversion of Control (IoC)]]
      - [[Dependency]]
      - [[Constructor Injection]]
      - [[Setter Injection]]
      - [[Parameter Injection]]
      - [[Backdoor Injection]]
  - [[Structural Design Pattern]]
  - [[Behavioural Design Pattern]]
    - [[Data Access Object]]
    - [[Marker Interface]]
    - [[Strategy Pattern]]
