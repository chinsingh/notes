# Grip Decreases with Shoe Sole Firmness

Shoes can have hard soles (Woodland etc.) or soft soles(hunter shoes).

Soft sole shoes provide the best grip, but they wear out quick.

On the other hand, hard sole shoes don't provide much grip, especially on ice, but are much more durable.

The ideal shoe would be the one with just the right sole firmness to last long and provide good grip as well.
