# Database Engineering MOC

- [[Relational Database]]

## Transaction Management / Database consistency

- [[Process]]
- [[Transaction]]
- [[Process vs Transaction]]
- [[Transaction State]]s
- [[Transactions are performed on buffer]]
- [[Result of Concurrent Transactions]]
- [[Transactions maketh a Database consistent]]
- [[ACID]]: [[Atomicity]] + [[Consistency]] + [[Isolation]] + [[Durability]]
- [[Dirty Read]]

## [[Data Modelling]]

- [[Normalization]] - [[First Normal Form]], [[Second Normal Form]], [[Third Normal Form]], [[BCNF]]

## SQL

- [[Transactions in SQL]]
- [[Orderby after Groupby]]
- [[ACID properties in SQL]]
- Variants: [[OpenSQL]]

## Searching / Optimization

- [[Indexing]]
  - [[Sparse Index]]ing
  - [[Dense Index]]ing
  - [[Primary Index]]ing
  - [[Clustered Index]]ing
  - [[Secondary Index]]ing
  - [[Multilevel Index]]ing
  - [[Index tables are always sorted]]
- [[using non-key attributes, LIKE statements and wildcards]]
- [[implicit clause when we say sorted or unsorted]]
- Caching: [[Database Buffer]]
- [[Join]]s
- Keys
  - [[Primary Key]] | [[Foreign Key]] | [[Unique Key]]
  - [[Primary Key vs Unique Key]]
