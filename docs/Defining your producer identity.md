> I'm a music producer primarily involved in pop rock and alternative genre. I have a friendly vibe which helps me for a relationship with client, making them feel safe to convey his/her emotions. I'm specifically skilled in post production and also in writing the song. I'm a singer and guitarist myself which helps me with composing the songs and understanding the vocalist. I love keeping things organized which is reflected in my workflow.
