# PB ratio

> P/B Ratio: Price to Book Ratio

$$
P/B = Share Price/B.V. per share
$$

- Example

    *P/B = 20/5 = 4*

    *This means that you’re paying ₹20 to buy ₹5 worth of the company’s assets. That is, if the company shuts down tomorrow, then you’ll only get ₹5, but you’re paying ₹20 or four times for those assets.*
