# Alternate buying and selling options for SGB

- There is also a second option, to sell your bonds in stock exchange.
- Similarly, if the subscription is not open for now, you can buy the bonds from stock market as well.
- There might be a problem of liquidity if you go for this option, although its very rare.
- You’ll have to sell this bond at the price of share market. It is not necessary that the price of the bond in share market will be same as price of gold in the market.
- Not all brokers give you the option to sell bonds like this. (Zerodha doesn’t)
- So the **best option** is to buy the bond, either through your broker if it offers you that option, or when the government opens up the scheme, and **keep it with you for the complete period of 8 years**. This way, you’ll get the interest for 8 years, as well as the returns will be great when you redeem it.
