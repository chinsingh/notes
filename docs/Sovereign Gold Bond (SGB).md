    That is, RBI will buy the bond back from you only after 8 years and will pay according to the price at that time.

  - Lock-in Period: 5 years (Not really. Check [[Alternate buying and selling options for SGB]])

    There is also an option to redeem the bond after 5 years, but you won’t get the interest for the 6th, 7th and 8th year.
    But in any case, you’ll have to keep it with you for 5 years.
