There are certain businesses in which the companies have no bargaining power. Thus, they suffer very low margins, and hence are able to give very low returns to the shareholders.

One such industry is railway. Railways lists its products and specification, and whoever offers it that at the cheapest price gets the contract. Manufactures hence compete to provide the product at lowest possible cost. This makes them sacrifice the profit margin.

Pharmaceuticals and FMCG where sellers are few and buyers are almost the entire humanity. Thus, they have great margins.
