# 4% Withdrawal Rule

Corpus Reqd = 25 times of your estimated Annual Expenses.

Eg- if your annual expense after 50 years of age is 500,000 and you wish to take VRS then corpus with you required is 1.25 cr.

Put 50% of this into fixed income & 50% into equity.

Withdraw 4% every yr, i.e.5 lac.

This rule works for 96% of time in 30 yr period
