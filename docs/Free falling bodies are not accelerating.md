The body wouldn't be said to accelerate since, [[Matter Bends Space]] and the body is just following the [[geodesic]] in space.
	
The free falling object is also doing the same. In classical physics, we would have said, since the object is undergoing [[acceleration due to gravity]],  it is a [[non-inertial frame of reference]]  and hence the object is experiencing a [[pseudo force]] when free falling which is making it weightless.  But general relativity tells us to consider it from the frame of reference of the body. If the body is not experiencing any net force, it is in an [[Inertial Frame of Reference]]. 
	
We will only call it an acceleration once the body hits the ground and stops.

Depending on where you look from, you can call this a result of or a proof that [[Gravity is NOT a force]]
