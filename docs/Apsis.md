*Greek
Plural: Apsides*

Generic term for the farthest or nearest point in the orbit of a planetary body about its primary body.

[[Farthest point on orbit is apo, nearest is peri + greek suffix for the primary body]] 

Therefore the generic term for farthest point is Apoapsis and for the nearest point is periapsis.
