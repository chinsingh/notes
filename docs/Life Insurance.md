# Life Insurance

> Insurance first, investment later

Get a life insurance as soon as you get your first salary, because the younger you are while buying the insurance, the lesser will be the premium and it will stay the same for the whole policy duration.

[[True Purpose of a Life Insurance is to serve as a replacement when a source of income dies]]

## Analysing Insurances because [[You can't trust your agents blindly]]

Things to look for:

- Coverage
  - [[Life Insurance Coverage should be 10-15 times your annual income]]
  - [[Only death coverage is not enough]]
- [[Claim Settlement]]
- Other Criteria you can use to filter out companies
  - Claim Rejection Ratio:
    Shows how many claims were rejected up front.
  - [[Assets Under Management (AUM)]]:
    - More the AUM, more capable the company is for passing claims in times of crisis.
    - [[LIC]], [[HDFC Life]] and [[Tata AIA]] have the highest AUMs.
  - [[Solvency]]
    - Companies are bound to maintain a minimum or 1.5 solvency ratio so that in case of any contingency in future, it is able to settle all claims.
    - Higher the better.

Avoid:

- [[Limited Pay]]
- [[Return on premium]]

Good Options:

- [[Max Life]]
- [[LIC]]
- [[ICICI Prudential]]
- [[HDFC Life]]
- [[Tata AIA]]

## Procedure to Buy

- The insurance can be bought online through [policybazaar](https://www.policybazaar.com/) or the companyâ€™s website, although few processes like medical tests will have to be done, so the process is not completely online.
- Buying online DOES NOT affect claim settlement.
- Remember to [[Tell your family members how to claim]]
- If you buy through policybazaar, they act as your agent and help you in the settlement process and you don't have to pay any commission for this.
- Medical Test: You can opt for either a telemedical (virtual) or a physical medical test and the company will arrange for it. Also no, [[Telemedical Test won't affect your claim settlement]].

Life Insurance can come in different variants:

- [[Term Insurance]]
- [[Whole Life Insurance]]
- [[Endowment Plans]]
- [[Unit-Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP)]]
