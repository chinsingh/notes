# Four Strokes

Four Stokes mean the [[Piston]] moves up and down 4 times to complete one cycle.

## Intake Stroke

In the first stroke, the piston goes down and lets the air in through the [[Air Intake Valve]].

## Compression Stoke

The second stroke is when the piston goes up and compresses the air.

## Combustion Stroke

Combustion of the fuel in air and hence, expansion which results in the piston moving down.

## Exhaust Stroke

The piston goes up and gases from the combustion process are released through [[Exhaust Valve]].
