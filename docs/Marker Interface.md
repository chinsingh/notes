# Marker Interface

aka **Tag Interface**

[[Structural Design Pattern]] used to associate metadata with a class.

- Such interface generally does not contain its own interface components,
- Denotes a particular behavior
  - whereas Typical interfaces specify functionality
- Serves as metadata
  - provides a means to associate metadata with a class where the language does not have explicit support for such metadata.
- Changes the way implementing classes are handled by the Compiler
