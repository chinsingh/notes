# Return on premium

- Return on premium option allows the customer to pay some higher amount (double premium in most cases) and get their money back after the term ends.
- Point to be noted — You'll get back the same amount you paid to the company - WITHOUT ANY INTEREST/RETURNS — after 40-50 years. What will be its worth?

Its like a mutual fund with 0% returns.

- Return on premium for peace of mind?
    As ridiculous as having chocolate for lunch breakfast and dinner because it just makes you feel good.
