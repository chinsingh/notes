# AABA Form

- For a long time sections were named as A, B, C and so on.
- A sections have the same melody and harmony, but often different lyrics. B section introduces a new melody, harmony and lyrics.
- Many songs in the 40s were primarily written following the AABA form. A lot of Jazz standards are in this form.
