# Management shouldn't eat up the profits

If the managers and CEO of the company take hefty salaries, it decreases the profit of the company as the salaries are an expense for the company.

There are many companies where the management itself eats up large parts of the profit by taking crores of salaries.

On the other hand, there are companies where the top management takes just a few thousand or even a rupee as their salary.

Steer clear of the first kind.

If the management combined takes less than 5% of the profit, then its reasonable.
