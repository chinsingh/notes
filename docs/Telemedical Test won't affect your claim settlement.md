# Telemedical Test won't affect your claim settlement

- At times, you yourself don't know about an existing ailment. Even though unknowingly, you're still giving the wrong information. This can affect your settlement.
- You can opt for a physical test if you aren't sure and haven't had a medical test in past one year.
- At the end of day, what matters is that the information provided by you is accurate. If it is, then telemedical won't hinder your settlement.
