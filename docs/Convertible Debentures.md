# Convertible Debentures

- Convertible debentures can be converted to shares after a specified time period. The company can issue shares for the debenture holders.
- If the debenture is convertible, it will be clearly mentioned on the bond certificate along with the time period after which it can be converted and at what price.
- After getting converted, you won't get the fixed interest. Instead you'll receive the dividend and the share price growth.
