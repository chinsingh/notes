Despite the expectation of rise in lifestyle diseases in India, the sales growth of Zydus in the last five years quite surprisingly has been negative. Reasons might be lack of any new product launches, and that the market might not have grown much.

Therefore, there are two ways for Zydus to grow. Either the industry grows which increases its market share. Or it can launch a new product.

Apart from all these, **return on equity, return on capital employed** are very satisfying. Moreover, its a **zero-debt company** which is always preferable.
