# Limited Pay

Limited Pay option allows you to pay for a lesser amount of time at a higher premium while providing the coverage for the full-term.

## Example Case Study

Regular term plan — Pay ₹1500 monthly premium for 50 years term.

Limited Pay — Pay ₹3000 monthly premium for only 10 years. Cover for 50 years.

You might want to go for this option, because it seems profitable and you're scared that if

[[something will happen in 10 years and you won't be able to pay the premium]]

You're serving the power of compounding on a silver plate to someone else if you opt for this.

At a glance, it may seem like you're saving a ton of money by just paying a little higher.

- When you pay through a regular plan (considering the above example)

    Total amount you end up paying = ₹1500 x 12 months x 50 years = ₹9 Lakh

- When you pay through limited pay option

    Total amount you end up paying = ₹3000 x 12 months x 10 years = ₹3.60 Lakh

- It may seem that you're saving ₹5.40 here if you go by the limited pay option.
- You may think if [[something will happen in 10 years and you won't be able to pay the premium]] — this looks like a safer option too.
- Question to be asked
  - Company not owned by my chacha. Why bada dil and give me so much discount?
  - But consider the compounding and inflation
    - Compounding
      - Suppose instead of going through limited pay, you paid the regular premium.
        - Now the other ₹1500 which you were going to put in the insurance, you decide to invest it in an SIP (average return = 12% p.a.)
        - After 13 years, you get ₹1500 x 12 x 13 @12% CAGR = 5.50 Lakh
        - This is how you'll pay the remaining interest if [[something will happen in 10 years and you won't be able to pay the premium]]
        - The amount you were saving over the period of FIFTY YEARS, you've made more than that by investing it, in just THIRTEEN YEARS.
        - Now it is not necessary that [[something will happen in 10 years and you won't be able to pay the premium]]. It might happen that all is well and you're paying the premium without any trouble.
        - In this case, suppose you continue your SIP.
          - The amount you'll make if you continue your SIP for
            - 30 years — ₹1500 x 12 x 30 @12% CAGR = 53 lakh
            - 50 years — ₹1500 x 12 x 50 @12% CAGR = ~5.75 Crore.
        - Another Example — Even if you just invest one months premium right now. After 10 years, it will grow up to be ₹4600 @12%. Your one month's premium right now is capable of paying premium for 3 months in the future.
    - Inflation
      - What will ₹1500 be worth after 10 years?
      - After 10 years, paying ₹1500 will be equivalent to giving peanuts.
      - Turns out company is not of your chacha
      - If you give just ₹1500 to the company after 40-50 years. It'll buy a packet of lays with it.
      - But if you give the same 1500 to the company right now, its worth much more to the company since it can compound it. You're giving the company, the gift of both time (to compound the money) and value (higher value of 1500 right now)
