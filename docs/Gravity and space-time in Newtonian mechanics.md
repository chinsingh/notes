# Gravity and space-time in Newtonian mechanics

The underlying assumption of Newtonian mechanics was that 
1. Space is fixed
2. Time is fixed.
3. Gravity is a mysterious action-at distance. 
	A mysterious force which acted from one massive body to another from a distance without interacting locally with it. 
4. Gravity acted within fixed space-time.
