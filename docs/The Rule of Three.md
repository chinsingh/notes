# The Rule of Three

Not really a rule, but tendencies. You can call it a principle and [[a principle is just in principle]]. Can be helpful.

- The Rule of Three
  - Most records that really work and are successful arrangement-wise basically have three things going on:
    - The Lead

            Vocal/Lead Instrument

    - The Rhythm Section

            Acts as a cohesive unit

    - The Wild Card
      - Something that isn't the lead or rhythm but doing something else.
  - Example - Sultans of Swing- Dire Strait

        All the instruments in the rhythm are really coupled together.

        Then there's the lead vocal

        The wild card - Mark Knopfler's lead guitar

  - Used not just in popular music but even in classical music. Example - Beethoven's symphonies
- Cognitive Load
  - Total amount of mental effort being used.
  - The rule of three works to keep the number of things human mind has going on at a time to the minimum.
- Some examples that are a little more complex
  - I am the Walrus - The Beatles
    - The wild card keeps shifting.
    - Rhythm section keeps a quarter note pulse which keeps the rhythm section together.
    - John Lennon on lead vocals which is very distorted with strange lyrics.
    - Wild card tends to go between strange cello lines, the choir of vocals that's going up and down and a lot of time is being handed off between these things.
    - Sometimes the cellos switch from being the wild card to the quarter note pulse becoming part of the rhythm section as one other element takes over as the wild card.
  - Uptown Funk

        Wild card goes between the background vocals and the brass
