# Parallel

Parallelism is when multiple computations are *executed* at a time. Therefore at any instant, multiple executions are ongoing simultaneously. 

Parellel computing doesn't need multiple tasks. Even one task can be split up into multiple sub-tasks and be assigned to different cores of the processor.
