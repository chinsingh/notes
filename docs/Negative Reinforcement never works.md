# Negative Reinforcement never works

> Don't criticize, condemn or complain.

- If you tell someone that they're wrong, they come into defensive mode. Irrespective of whether they're wrong or not. They WILL defend themselves.
- No one ever believes they're wrong. Even the most hardened criminals will justify their acts or deny the acts were criminal in the first place. No matter what they say, their ego (and again everyone has one no matter what they say) doesn't let them believe they were wrong.
- It doesn't matter if someone is good at taking criticism, or you have to tell them for their own good. Don't ever critique.
- Condemnation doesn't incur lasting changes and causes resentment.
- People remember things. Some show, some don't. Some push it to the back of their minds, some don't. But they will resent you. Maybe even subconsciously. They won't know the reason, but they'll slowly drift apart.
- It WILL destroy your relationships.
- Have a little empathy and see the world from their place for once and you might even understand why they're doing what they're doing. Don't be a shrimp and tell them your analysis. Just try to understand their point of view and find out a different way to explain them why they should be doing something else than what they're doing. Be kind.
