# Issues with VMs

- Each [[Virtual Machine]] still needs its own OS, which itself consumes a lot of resources even without applications running on the VM. In this scenario — more the applications, more the waste.
- Each VM is also an attack vector
- Along with resource wastage, it comes with some potential overheads —
  - License cost - For all the VMs
  - Admin stuff - Patching, updates, antivirus etc.
