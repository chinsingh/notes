# [[Brand Power]] is more important for a B2C company than a B2B company

B2C Companies are more likely to benefit from brand power.

For example, in case of tyres, there are two primary market segments

1. OEM segment: Tyres which are already put on the vehicles by the automobile manufacturing company.
2. Replacement market: Which customers buy while replacing worn out tyres

MRF is particularly strong in replacement market. This provides it with pricing power. This is because it can charge more from its customers because of its brand power; but if it charges automobile company at higher price, it wonâ€™t accept that price. Due to this pricing power, it is able to generate greater profit margin. Thus, tyre companies which are stronger in replacement market are better.
