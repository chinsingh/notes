# Einstein Synchronization Convention

Since, the [[One-way speed of light can't be measured]]. Einstein in his 1905 paper took this as a convention that speed of light from A to B and B to A is the same.

> Light’s one-way speed “is in reality neither a supposition nor a hypothesis about the physical nature of light, but a stipulation which I can make of my own freewill in order to arrive at a [[Definition of Simultaneity]] [A. Einstein, Relativity: The Special and General Theory, authorized translation by R. W. Lawson (New York: Crown Publishers, 1961), pp. 22–23.]
