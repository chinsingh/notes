# Measuring Speed of Light

How do you measure the speed of anything?

You know the distance between any two points and then you see how much time that thing took to reach from point A to point B.

In case of light, you can do a similar thing. You take a vaccum tube, have a clock at one end and start that once a laser beam is fired. Then you have another clock which should stop at the time the beam reaches the end of the tube. 

But we didn't start the second clock in the first place. It should start at the same time the first clock starts so that we can know the time. So we synchronise the clocks by putting a wire in between and starting the second clock by sending a signal from the first clock when it starts. But the signal travelling through that wire is actually an electromagnetic wave and [[Electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light]]. So now there's a delay between the two clocks and the laser has passed anyway.

Another way could be to synchronize the clocks and then move the second clock to the end of the tube. But due to [[Time Dilation]], the second (moving) clock will tick slower in comparison to the first (stationary).

The only solution to this problem till now is to ditch the second clock. 

Put a mirror at the end of the tube and measure the difference between light leaving and returning back.
