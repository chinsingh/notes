Gravity is just a result of object following their [[geodesic]]s along space-time. And Since [[Matter Bends Space]] objects curve towards the matter.

Its as it two people start walking straight on their longitudes from equator towards the poles. It would appear as if there's a force pushing the two of them together as they walk towards the pole. But its just them following there path, and the path is merging.
