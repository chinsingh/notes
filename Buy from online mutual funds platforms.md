# Buy from online mutual funds platforms

If you go about investing through individual websites for the specific mutual funds you want to buy,

-   You'll have to create a separate account on each website
-   You will only be able to see mutual funds provided by that AMC
-   You won't be able to see all your holdings and scheme performance at one place

Earlier, mutual fund platforms only offered [[regular plan]]s. But nowadays a lot of platforms have [[direct plan]]s as well. This solves all three problems mentioned above.
