# Benefits of Filing ITR

-   Can act as an income proof while availing loans from banks
    
-   Helps you get income tax refund
	- Excess TDS deducted by Employer/Bank
	- For example, your employer deducts some TDS even though you are not eligible to pay any tax. Or your FD completed its period and the bank deducted TDS and paid you the remaining amount. Even in this case you are not liable to pay tax.
	- Even if your gross total income is less than minimum exemption limit, you will have to file ITR if you want to claim refunds in such cases.

-   Carry forward of capital loss/business loss
    
    Suppose in a particular year, you incurred a loss of 50k in share market. The next year you earn a profit of 80k. If you didn't file ITR in the first year, you'll have to pay tax on the complete amount of 80k. While, if you had filled ITR earlier, that loss would be adjusted in the 80k, and you'd have to pay tax only on 30k.
