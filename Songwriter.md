# Songwriter

Songwriters, like composers, create music but operate within a more traditional song structure, that usually includes writing lyrics as well. Songwriters often write songs either for themselves or for others to perform or record. If you're a songwriter, you'll definitely need to know basic audio and music production when you're starting out in order to produce recordings of your own songs,either as demos or as final products.
