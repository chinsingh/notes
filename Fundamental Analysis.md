# Fundamental Analysis

Its the analysis for intrinsic or fair value of the stock on basis of certain parameters.

Never rely on what your eyes see. A business may seem prospering and very popular, but it might not be earning as much. Look for P/E, returns etc. to analyse rationally and rely on that.
