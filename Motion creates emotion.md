# Motion creates emotion

Make melodies move. If you notice your melodies aren't moving around, you might want to do something about that.

A lot of people find a chord progression they really like and they find notes in there to hold onto. The problem is sometimes you get stuck.

- When less motion can be helpful?

    So if your melodies are in the same place. That can be fine - especially if your character is heart broken or emotionally frozen.

Here are some ways to get some motion going on:

- Stepwise motion
  - You can try going up and down the scale. May be make the melody move a step up or down.
- Intervals
  - Skipping notes
  - Try notes in the chords first
- Rub notes
  - Notes which are not in the chord
  - For example, the note next to the one in chord.
  - This can make it a little more mysterious or if your character is unstable or unsure.
- Use your range
  - Figure out your high note and low note
  - Try jumping into falsetto
  - You can also use it to differentiate between different sections
    - To make the chorus pay of, a lot of songs have the chorus at a higher register. Example, You're not the only one - Sam Smith, The hills - The Weeknd
    - Or you can try the opposite of that

Mix it up. Do it with intention. Try and get motion in your songs.
