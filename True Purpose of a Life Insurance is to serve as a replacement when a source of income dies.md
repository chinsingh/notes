# True Purpose of a Life Insurance is to serve as a replacement when a source of income dies

The purpose of life insurance as many people think, is not to invest or to compensate for the loss of a "loved one". Money definitely won't be able to compensate for someone's loss.

The only purpose of the insurance is when an earning member of a family dies, a source of income gets taken away. The people who are dependent on him should not have to worry about survival or lowering their living standards at the time of grief.

The life insurance claim money serves as a replacement for the source of income that is gone.
