# Dividend Policy is decided on the basis of reinvestment plans

Companies which don't expect a lot of growth or where they don't have to put their profits back in the business.

For example, Coal India. It doesn't have to spend a lot on advertisement, expanding etc. in order to make profit. Its a monopoly in mining industry and will continue to make consistent profit every year. So, it knows it can't do much with the profit and there is no point just keeping the profits. Hence, this profit is distributed among the shareholders. Although it has higher dividend yield, the downside though, is that it won't show much growth either. 

A fast growing company on the other hand, prefers to invest its profits back in business in order to grow. 

Thus, usually, you can say that if a company is giving out higher dividends, it doesn't expects to grow much.

ðŸ’¡ Obviously, there are exceptions. There are certain companies which don't require a lot of capital to be invested in their business to continue growing fast. These companies too can choose to distribute a larger part of their profit among shareholders and still grow at a quick pace.
